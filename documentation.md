# Team-HaxLab Documentation for the AA SkySafe Simulation

## Description
This file contains all of the essential documentation for you to use the AA SkySafe Simulation successfully!

* In the development of our pre-flight safety demonstration in virtual reality (VR), we leveraged several key technologies to create an immersive and engaging experience. Here are the technologies that played a pivotal role in our project:

*In-World AI
In-World AI brings an added layer of interactivity and realism to our VR safety demonstration. We've integrated AI characters that act as virtual flight attendants, guiding users through the safety procedures. This AI can respond to user actions and questions, making the experience more dynamic and educational.

*Ready Player Me
Ready Player Me is an avatar creation platform that enhances user engagement in our VR environment. Users can create personalized avatars, making the experience more relatable and enjoyable. This integration adds a social aspect to the VR safety demonstration, as users can see and interact with each other through their avatars.

*PlayHT
PlayHT is a valuable technology for enhancing the interactivity and engagement of our VR application. It allows users to interact with objects and elements in the VR environment, making the safety demonstration more hands-on and immersive.

*Unity and C#
Unity, combined with the programming language C#, forms the core of our development environment. Unity is a versatile game engine that allows us to build and deploy our VR experience efficiently. C# is the programming language used to script and code the functionality of the VR environment, including interactions and AI behavior.

*Oculus Quest 2
The Oculus Quest 2 is the VR hardware platform we selected for our project. It offers a wireless, standalone VR experience, making it accessible and user-friendly. The headset and controllers provide a high-quality VR experience, making it the perfect choice for our safety demonstration.


## How To Run The AA SkySafe Simulation
* Step 1. Unzip the Project:

Locate the Unity project folder that you want to run.
Right-click on the folder and select "Extract All" (or a similar option) to unzip the contents to a new directory.
Install Unity Hub (if not already installed):
Download and install Unity Hub from the official Unity website.

* Step 2. Open Unity Hub:

Launch Unity Hub after installation.

* Step 3. Add Your Project:

Click the "Projects" tab on the left panel of Unity Hub.
Click the "Add" button and browse to the unzipped Unity project folder.
Select the project folder and click "Open."

* Step 4. Configure Project Settings:

Unity Hub will recognize your project and display it in the list.
Click on your project in the list, and Unity Hub will show you the available Unity versions. Select the appropriate Unity version for your project.

* Step 5. Open Your Project:

Click the "Open" button to launch your Unity project in the selected Unity version.

## Running The .exe File

* Step 1. Build Your Project:

In Unity, make sure your project is built for your target platform. You can do this by going to "File" > "Build Settings" and selecting the target platform (e.g., Windows).

* Step 2. Build the Project:

Click the "Build" button in the Build Settings window.
Choose a location to save the built executable (.exe) file and click "Save."

* Step 3. Run the .exe File:

Locate the saved .exe file on your computer.
Double-click the .exe file to run your Unity project outside of the Unity Editor.
