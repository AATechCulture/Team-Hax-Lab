## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
*How can we engage users to properly follow airline safety protocols?

*How can we get users to pay attention while airline safety instructions are being given?

*How can virtual reality solve the problem of attentiveness while safety instructions are being given?


## Project Description 🤯
**Embark on an immersive virtual reality journey to master in-flight emergency response. Our innovative VR experience guides you through American Airlines’ pre-flight safety demonstrations, building your confidence and preparedness for onboard crises. With realistic scenarios and interactive training, you'll gain practical skills to ensure the safety and well-being of both yourself and fellow passengers in unexpected situations, making your air travel experiences more secure and empowering.**

## Project Value 💰
**The VR experience seems to cater to a broad audience, including those seeking education, training, or simply a more engaging way to understand and prepare for in-flight emergencies. However, it may primarily target those with an interest in aviation and air travel, as well as individuals looking to enhance their safety knowledge while making their flight experiences more enjoyable and secure.**
